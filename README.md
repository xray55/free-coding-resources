## 🤖 How It Works
1.  **The Hunter:** A `Hunter Agent` searches for official documentation, GitHub "Awesome" lists, and free verified books. It uses archives like WeLib only as a backup.
2.  **The Reviewer:** A `Reviewer Agent` checks edition numbers and user reviews to reject outdated content.
3.  **The Editor:** A `Chief Editor Agent` updates this README with a summary of the latest finds.
4.  **Deployment:** The system rebuilds the static HTML dashboard and pushes to GitHub Pages.
