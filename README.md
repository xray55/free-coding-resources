## 🤖 How It Works
1.  **Dual-Core Agents:** Two AI agents search simultaneously for different languages to maximize efficiency.
2.  **The Reviewer:** Checks edition numbers and user reviews.
3.  **The Editor:** Summarizes findings from both agents into a single dispatch.
4.  **Deployment:** The system rebuilds the static HTML dashboard and pushes to GitHub Pages.
