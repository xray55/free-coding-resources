## 🤖 How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** Windows Task Scheduler wakes up the Python kernel.
2.  **The Hunt:** A `Hunter Agent` (Ollama/Qwen) searches for high-quality resources (Strict Mode: No URL = No Entry).
3.  **Balancing:** The system auto-detects which languages have fewer resources and prioritizes them.
4.  **Deployment:** The system rebuilds the static HTML dashboard and pushes to GitHub Pages.
