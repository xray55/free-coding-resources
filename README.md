## 🤖 How It Works
This project runs on a completely autonomous loop:
1.  **Trigger:** Windows Task Scheduler wakes up the Python kernel.
2.  **The Hunt:** A `Hunter Agent` (powered by Ollama/Qwen) searches for high-quality resources for a specific language (Python, Rust, C++, etc.).
3.  **Verification:** The AI filters fake links and validates the quality (1950s–Present).
4.  **Deployment:** The system rebuilds the static HTML dashboard and pushes the results to GitHub Pages.
